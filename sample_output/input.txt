The American Revolution was a pivotal conflict in world history that led to the birth of the United States. It spanned from 1775 to 1783 and was the result of growing tensions between the American colonies and the British government. The conflict was rooted in issues of taxation without representation, British interference in colonial affairs, and a desire for self-governance among the colonies. Key philosophical influences included Enlightenment ideas about liberty, democracy, and individual rights.
One of the earliest acts of defiance was the Boston Tea Party in 1773, during which American colonists, protesting the Tea Act imposed by Britain, dumped an entire shipment of tea into Boston Harbor. This event intensified the conflict and led to harsh British retaliatory laws. In 1775, open hostilities began with the battles of Lexington and Concord, often referred to as the "shot heard 'round the world."
On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson. This document officially stated that the thirteen American colonies considered themselves free and independent states. George Washington was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army and led the colonies through key battles, including Trenton, Saratoga, and the decisive Siege of Yorktown in 1781.
The war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783. This treaty officially ended the conflict and recognized the sovereignty of the United States. The Revolution not only established a new nation but also inspired other global movements for democracy and independence. It laid the foundation for the U.S. Constitution and set a precedent for the principles of liberty, federalism, and popular sovereignty that continue to shape democracies today.
